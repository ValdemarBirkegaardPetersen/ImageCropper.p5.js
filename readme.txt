A functional image-cropper made with mainly p5.js. In this version, there is no styling just pure HTML code and the p5 canvas. When the image have been uploaded on page one, the user is redirected to the second page where the main p5.js image cropping script is based. Feel free to use. In my spare time i will improve it and use it for another side-project i'm doing where it will function as a single feature 

Three libraries are used:
p5.js
jQuery.js
jQuery.storage.js
